To setup a react application:
- Create and setup react app, using following commands:
(New method: Vite)
	npm create vite@latest app -- --template react
	npm install
	cd app (to go into your newly created application's dir)
	npm run dev (to run application on (by default) port#5173)

(Old method: create-react-app)
	npx create-react-app app
	cd app
	npm start (to run application on (by default) port#3000)

- npm install axios
- Make db.json file in root directory and store initial data (which act as a portable backend database)
- npm install -g json-server (does the global installation, if not installed previously, then install it)
- npm install json-server --save-dev (not sure what this is)
- now run server, by using powershell and change current dir to your react app
- write: npx json-server --port 3001 --watch /db.json
- open browser and open link: http://localhost:3001/dataObj (dataObj is the name of collection used to store data objects in db.json)
